# Project-15---Hangman-Game
A Python Hangman Game, containing a wordlist !

This code is a little bigger but I would still consider it a beginner project.

This is a full-on hangman game I created as part of my "beginner project" adventure, advancing in software engineering.

It contains a worlist in a separate file, linked to the main Hangman Game file. You will find all of the information about the code ... in the code ! :D

See you in Project 16 ! (Might be intermediary !)
